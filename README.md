T-Shot
==========

Feature tracking in urban heterogeneous data is a challenging problem in scientific visualization.
The data are often spatial-temporal, multi-variate and multi-modal and the related methods are hard to be integrated, which makes it difficult for scientists to track the domain-specific features.
In this paper, we propose a shot composition method based on space-time clustering and importance function to help scientists tracking the evolution of features.
We also introduce a set of rules and design a storyboard view based on scene graph to help domain experts set the tracking intent interactively.
The experiments show that our method gets better results than the conventional methods on both the tsunami evacuation dataset and the airflow dataset.
